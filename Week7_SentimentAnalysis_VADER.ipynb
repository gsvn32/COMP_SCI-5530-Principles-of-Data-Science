        "VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media. VADER uses a combination of A sentiment lexicon is a list of lexical features (e.g., words) which are generally labelled according to their semantic orientation as either positive or negative.\n",
        "\n",
        "VADER is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. It can be applied directly to unlabeled text data.\n",
        "\n",
        "VADER sentimental analysis relies on a dictionary that maps lexical features to emotion intensities known as sentiment scores. The sentiment score of a text can be obtained by summing up the intensity of each word in the text.\n",
        "For example- Words like ‘love’, ‘enjoy’, ‘happy’, ‘like’ all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is intelligent enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as “did not love” as a negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as “ENJOY”\n",

        "**Polarity classification**\n",
        "\n",
        "VADER is mainly used for polarity classification, in this approach We won’t try to determine if a sentence is objective or subjective, fact or opinion. Rather, we care only if the text expresses a positive, negative or neutral opinion.\n",
        "\n",
        "VADER has been found to be quite successful when dealing with social media texts, NY Times editorials, movie reviews, and product reviews. This is because VADER not only tells about the Positivity and Negativity score but also tells us about how positive or negative a sentiment is.\n",
